# MeshRepairBenchmark

Measures how well `gs.MeshAutoRepair` repairs real-world broken meshes, and what it breaks on the way.
The data comes from [Thingi10K](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Thingi10K/Thingi10K).

## Usage
```
python3 fetch_data.py            # ~1.5 GB: 400 meshes <= 100k faces + 30 meshes 100k..1M faces (--no-large skips those)
./run_all.sh default             # MeshAutoRepair
./run_all.sh cleanup             # MeshAutoRepair with PostRepairCleanup = true
./run_all.sh instr               # instrumented pipeline copy, quality after every step
./run_all.sh robust              # MeshRobustRepair: cleanup, solidify fallback, volume check
BENCH_P=2 ./run_all.sh hybrid    # BENCH_P: meshes in parallel
python3 analyze_fidelity.py results/robust.jsonl    # repaired = clean + no self-intersections + faithful
python3 analyze.py results/default.jsonl            # status per category, exceptions, triangle loss
python3 analyze_quality.py results/cleanup.jsonl    # quality before/after
python3 analyze_stages.py results/instr.jsonl       # which pipeline step introduces which defect
```

`run_all.sh <mode> [loader] [transform] [tolerance factor]` takes these options:
- **loader:** `std` (StandardMeshReader, STL welding), `soup` (no welding) or `manual` (own exact weld + `AppendTriangle`)
- **transform:** `meters` (scale ×0.001) or `geo` (translate by 500000, 5000000, 0)
- **tolerance factor:** multiplies `RepairTolerance` and `MinEdgeLengthTol`

Each mesh runs in its own process with a timeout (120 s, large meshes 900 s), so hangs and crashes are recorded too.

The data selection is fixed (seeded) in `fetch_data.py`:
- 6 defect categories × 60 broken meshes: not closed, not edge-manifold, not vertex-manifold,
  degenerate faces, duplicated faces, not PWN
- 40 clean controls
- 30 large broken meshes

Thingi10K models have individual licenses, see `data/input_summary.csv`.

## Quality metrics
Each metric is counted before and after the repair:

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| boundary edges | open edges |
| bowtie vertices | non-manifold vertices |
| inconsistent orientation | interior edges whose two triangles traverse it in the same direction |
| duplicate triangles | same vertex set |
| degenerate triangles | area < 1e-12 · diag² |
| sliver triangles | aspect ratio > 1000 |
| folds | dihedral angle > 175° |
| self-intersections | triangle pairs without a shared vertex; coplanar overlaps are not detected |
| exact self-intersections (`selfint_exact`) | `MeshRepairMetrics.SelfIntersections`: exact predicates, also pairs sharing a vertex or an edge and coplanar overlaps |
| inside-out components | closed, negative volume, not a cavity of another component |
| Hausdorff (`hd_fwd/back_lo/hi_rel`) | certified bounds (`MeshHausdorffDistance`) in both directions, relative to the diagonal |
| volume IoU (`iou`, `iou_missing`, `iou_extra`) | `MeshRepairMetrics.VolumeIoU`: 100k samples, inside = winding number > 0.5; reference is the input oriented like the solidify fallback (inside-out parts flipped) |

`analyze_fidelity.py` counts a mesh as **repaired** if it is topologically clean¹, has no exact
self-intersections, its Hausdorff upper bound is below 1 % of the diagonal in both directions and the IoU
is above 0.99. Thingi10K has no reference repairs, so the input itself (its winding number solid) is the
reference.

## Findings with geometry3Sharp 1.0.324 (NuGet)
- No exceptions, hangs or crashes in any of the following setups:
  - the three loaders
  - meshes up to 1M triangles
  - geo coordinates
- 398 of 400 meshes are closed after the repair, but only 144 are topologically clean.
- **`MinEdgeLengthTol` and `RepairTolerance` are absolute.** With data in meters instead of mm:
  - 118/400 meshes lose more than 10 % of their triangles (max 88 %).
  - 32 of the 40 clean meshes are changed.

  Scale both tolerances with the model size or unit.
- Defects introduced by the pipeline (meshes affected, out of 400):
  - duplicate triangles: 40
  - new degenerate triangles: 59
  - new folds: 66
  - inside-out components: 12
  - remaining bowties: 98
- Per step (`analyze_stages.py`):
  - Hole filling (`MinimalHoleFill`, `SimpleHoleFiller`) adds most degenerate triangles and folds.
  - `MeshEditor.DisconnectBowtie` opened 3108 new boundary edges in 9 meshes.
  - `MergeCoincidentEdges` adds duplicates and folds.
  - `MeshRepairOrientation.OrientComponents` can make orientation worse on non-orientable regions.

## Changes in this fork
1. **`MeshEditor.DisconnectBowtie` fix.** The old version grouped the one-ring triangles in a single,
   order-dependent pass and could split one fan into several pieces, which cut cracks into the mesh.
   It now unions the triangles over the edges at the vertex.
   Test: `tests/geometry3Sharp.Tests/MeshEditorBowtieTests.cs`. It fails with 1.0.324 (`dotnet test -p:UseNuGetG3=true`).
2. **`MeshPostRepairCleanup`** (new, `mesh_ops/`). It runs these steps:
   - remove duplicate triangle pairs
   - collapse needles and flip caps
   - flip folds, accepted only if the local fold count drops
   - disconnect bowties
   - reverse inside-out components that are not cavities
3. **`MeshAutoRepair.PostRepairCleanup`** (default `false`) runs the cleanup at the end of `Apply()`.

## Results with this fork (400 set; large set in the last row)
| | NuGet 1.0.324 | fork, default | fork, `PostRepairCleanup = true` |
|---|---|---|---|
| closed | 398 | 397 | 397 |
| topologically clean¹ | 144 | 146 | **289** |
| also no folds / self-intersections | 97 | 97 | **177** |
| meshes with bowtie vertices | 98 | 101 | 1 |
| meshes with duplicate triangles | 40 | 20 | 0 |
| meshes with degenerate triangles | 230 | 230 | 104 |
| meshes with folds | 257 | 257 | 204 |
| meshes with inside-out components | 17 | 14 | 3 |
| clean controls made worse | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| median / max repair time | 0.31 s / 3.7 s | 0.32 s / 3.9 s | 0.39 s / 4.9 s |
| large meshes topologically clean | 7/29 | 7/29 | **16/29** |

¹ closed, no bowties, consistently oriented, no duplicate or degenerate triangles, no inside-out components.

Known remaining issues:
- **Self-intersections are not handled by the cleanup.** `MeshRobustRepair` handles them with a solidify fallback (below).
- **About 100 meshes keep degenerate triangles** that can be neither collapsed nor flipped without creating new defects.
- **One mesh that could not be closed (53121.stl) keeps 2 bowtie vertices.**
- **Results vary slightly between runs (±1–3 defects).** `MeshRepairOrientation` and `MeshNormals` use `gParallel`.

## Fidelity results: solidify fallback and robust repair (400 set; large set in the last row)
Modes (`BENCH_REPAIR`):
- `hybrid_topo`: cleanup; if the result is not topologically clean, solidify the repaired mesh
  (`MeshWindingNumberSolidify`, adaptive dual contouring, resolution 128).
- `hybrid`: as `hybrid_topo`, and exact self-intersections also trigger the solidify.
- `solidify_dc_adaptive`: solidify the input directly.
- `robust`: `MeshRobustRepair`, the library version of `hybrid`. In addition, a clean result whose
  solid differs from the input's (volume IoU < 0.99) is replaced by the solidified input.

| | default | cleanup | hybrid_topo | hybrid | solidify | robust |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| clean¹ + no exact self-intersections | 100 | 188 | 265 | 342 | 316 | **347** |
| **repaired** (also Hausdorff < 1 %, IoU > 0.99) | 95 | 166 | 186 | **211** | 172 | **211** |
| median repair time | 0.37 s | 0.60 s | 0.68 s | 3.5 s | 5.4 s | 5.2 s |
| large meshes repaired | 4/30 | 5/30 | 6/30 | 9/30 | 6/30 | 9/30 |

The `solidify` run used an older build (before the dual contouring self-intersection fix); `hybrid` and
the earlier modes used the old IoU reference (raw winding number), which scored inside-out inputs as IoU 0.

`robust`, what triggers the solidify (400 meshes): kept the repair 173, self-intersections 96, degenerate
triangles 89 (almost all of them also self-intersect), inside-out components 25, volume differs from the
input 16, not closed 1. Three of the 40 clean controls are solidified: closed and manifold, but
self-intersecting.

Why `robust` misses the strict criterion (189 meshes):
- 116: the solidified mesh deviates more than 1 % (Hausdorff); a cell at resolution 128 is 0.8 % of the
  diagonal.
- 47: self-intersections remain after the solidify (hole fill of non-manifold cells, cells with several
  patches).
- 26: volume (IoU) or other.

Known remaining issues:
- Solidify fidelity is bounded by the grid (see the resolution 256 spike below).
- Dual contouring leaves triangles out where neighbouring cells split a shared face into patches
  differently; filling those holes can create self-intersections.
- Resolving self-intersections exactly (`ExactMeshBoolean.Resolve` on the repaired mesh) instead of
  solidifying keeps the input geometry. A first prototype on 20 failing meshes: 6 clean, the others open
  (the repaired mesh is not closed in the winding number sense) or with self-intersections from rounding
  the new vertices.
